# RENT-A-CAR
The Project is intended to provide a fast and efficient way for Administrators to edit their Car Inventory and the Customer to rent a car without having to go through the hassle of renting a car by going to the Car Shop itself. This is a simple program that allows both the Administrator of a Car-Rental and
the Customer to use the same interface for meeting their requirements.

Admin has options to :
1. Add new car to inventory
2. Delete car from inventory
3. view a particular car from inventory
4. view all cars in inventory
5. view rented cars
6. update availability status of a car in inventory

Customer :
1. Customer is shown the whole car list which has information about cars such as car name, fuel type, car colour, price per hour, availability
2. The customer has to put in the id of the car they want to choose
3. Then they are shown the car they chose and asked for number of days car is required for.
4. after that they are given a price for renting
5. then they are asked the date, time and location for car pickup
6. then they are shown a message telling when and where their car will be dropped off.
